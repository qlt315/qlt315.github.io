<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a third-year M.S. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Science at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn) (USTC), advised by [Prof. Hancheng Lu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~hclu) and [Prof. Feng Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=5bInRDEAAAAJ). I  was a graduate visiting student at [UC San Diego (UCSD)](https://ece.ucsd.edu/) , hosted by [Prof. Xinyu Zhang](http://xyzhang.ucsd.edu/) in 2023. I worked as a research intern with [Prof. Hamid Sadjadpour](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~hamid/) and [Prof. Zouheir Rezki](https://sites.google.com/site/zouheirrezki/home?authuser=0) at [UC Santa Cruz (UCSC)](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/electrical-and-computer-engineering/) in 2022. Prior to this, I received my B.E. in Information Engineering from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) (XDU) in 2021.

My research interests lie in wireless communication and networking systems, with a focus on theoretical analysis, optimization and system implementation of next-generation wireless architectures like **Cell-Free & User-Centric MIMO** / **Wireless Moble Edge Computing (MEC)** / **mmWave Networks** / **Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC)**, etc.

\color{red}{I will join UC Irvine as a PhD student in Computer Science this fall.}
